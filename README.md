CRM Dashboard: Sales Performance Analysis
This repository contains the analysis and Tableau dashboard for a project focused on tracking sales pipeline metrics, benchmarking team performance, and optimizing the sales funnel.

Objective
The primary goal of this project was to develop a comprehensive, interactive dashboard that provides sales leadership with a clear, real-time view of the sales pipeline. The dashboard is designed to identify bottlenecks in the sales process, highlight high-performing agents and products, and inform data-driven strategies to improve conversion rates.

Dataset
The analysis was performed on an anonymized sales dataset exported from a Salesforce CRM instance. The data includes information on deals, stages, sales agents, products, and revenue.

Tools & Technologies
Data Visualization & Dashboarding: Tableau
Data Preparation: Excel

Analysis & Key Findings
Dashboard Key Features
Pipeline Overview:

Funnel Metrics: Visualized the sales funnel from Prospecting → Engaging → Won/Lost.

Conversion Rates: Revealed that while 94% of prospecting deals progressed to the Engaging stage, only 51% were ultimately won.

Cycle Time Analysis: Calculated an average deal cycle length of 48 days.

Sales Team Performance:

Benchmarking: Built side-by-side comparisons to benchmark performance by region, manager, and individual sales agent.

Top Performer Spotlight: Identified top agents who outperformed peers by as much as 60%.

Product & Pricing Analysis:

Revenue by Product: Highlighted that the "GTX Pro" was the top-performing product, while "MG Special" underperformed.

Pricing Insight: Used calculated fields to detect markups and discounts against list price, revealing that only two products were consistently sold above target.

Key Business Insights
A significant bottleneck was detected in the late stages of the sales funnel, with a 49% drop-off rate after the initial engagement stage.

Q2 was identified as the highest-revenue quarter ($3.09M), while Q4 lagged, suggesting potential pricing issues or seasonality.

A strong correlation was found between specific agent/manager pairings and regional success.

Recommendations
Based on the findings, the following actionable recommendations were developed:

Investigate Q4 Pricing: Analyze the discounting behavior in Q4 to address the revenue lag and re-evaluate pricing strategies for underperforming products.

Replicate Success: Develop training programs based on the behaviors and strategies of top-performing agents to replicate their success across other regions.

Improve Funnel Conversion: Provide targeted training and support to improve negotiation and closing skills, addressing the late-stage funnel bottleneck.

Enhance Data Integrity: Implement more rigorous CRM data entry practices to ensure funnel reporting is accurate and reliable.
